12 volts 1 amp battery but when it is connectedin parallel series then current becomes 2 amps

2) we used four wheeled motors circuit by l293d motor driver

3) we used lm2596 voltage regulator  which converts 12v dc to 5v 2 amps
4) motors are connected to the L293d motor driver to pins of raspberry pi 4 model b in the pin ( 5,6,9,13) pins 
5) servo motor at 12 pin
ultrasonic sensor at 23 and 24 pin
6) there must be lan or any network connected to the specific name as project 5931  with pass of 123456789 as configured in the connection portal
7) inorder to get the ip address of the robot (raspberry pi ) when it was switched on and to check the ip address we have to install the network analyser application from the playstore in order to see the ip address ....
8) as we set our server at localhost of 5000...once the raspberry pi is rebooted ...and spyrobot and user has same n/w (same lan or any network)
9) once the network analyser is installed then...we have to look a ip address ....ip address is traced when there is same network for the robot and use end with project 5931 configuration....

10) once we get our ip address ...copy it and paste in the chrome in the new tab...
 11) then use pur server port number with a colon :5000/
12) then look at the chrome and wait untill it loads
 13) then we will be getting the web page ...where we started from a scratch ....
14) as we installed the python libraries like ex 

*/  import motors
import servo
import cam/*   // these are the libraries which are made by us...


the below following are the inbuilt libraries 

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import requests
import threading
import time
#import cv2
import numpy as np
import math
import commands
import socket

all these help in configuration of the web page to run and work accordingly.....
